In my latest rewrite of my blog I decided to use [EasyMDE](https://github.com/Ionaru/easy-markdown-editor) to write my blog posts. 

I am using [Laravel Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/) in my tech stack so I needed to figure out how to make EazyMDE and Livewire work together. 

To get the basics working it was not to bad.
